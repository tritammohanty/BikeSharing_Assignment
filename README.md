## General Information
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.
- They want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:
    - Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
    - How well those variables describe the bike demands
- We are using the bike sharing data provied by BoomBikes. Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered this dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors.

## Conclusions
- The Fall season had the most Demand generated.
- Demand had significantly gone up in 2019 as compared to 2018.
- June to September months had the most Demand for bikes.
- If it is a Holiday bike Demand is more.
- Over the Weekdays there is mostly similar Demand for bikes
- Though the median for Demand is similar even if it is a working day or not, the larger set of Demand is when it is not a Working day.
- If the Weather Situation is Clear or there are only a few clouds or it is Partly cloudy then the Demand for bikes is significantly high, whereas there is no Demand when there is Heavy Rain with falling Ice Pallets and Thunderstorms along with Mist or Snow with Fog
- As it approaches fall from Summer, Demand increases. It becomes steady demand during fall and drops as it advances in winter.
- Sunday sees a constant high demand irrespective of any season except spring. And demands usually flow in from Friday to Sunday.
- The Fall season sees demand irrespective of whether itâ€™s a working day or a holiday.
- Temperature is a determining factor for the demand of shared bikes.
